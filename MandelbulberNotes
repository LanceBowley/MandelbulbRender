IMPORANT STATIC PARAMETERS===========================================================================

FILE PATHS-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PNG/JPG: Image format
BACKGROUND: Image for the background if SHADERS1->TexturedBackground == true
ENVIRONMENT MAP: Image used for fake reflection 
AMBIENT OCCLUSION COLOR MAP: Path for the image used for ambient occulusion effect. This was called
the 'quick and dirty' of an environment map

ENGINE-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Detail level: How much 'depth' the engine looks for
DE step factor: Larger values gives larger steps but faster rendering. should be 0.5 to 1.0 for most. 
Too large of steps will cause artifacts
Smoothness: Controls level of detail too
Linear DE: typically used for hybrid fractals with shitty quality

SHADERS 1--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SHADING: Sets the level of shading. More or less higher shading gives better shadow gradients versus 
just black on white
SPECULARITY: How reflective a surface is
AMBIENT: Intensity of simple ambient light. Doesn't do much. Keep at zero
Ambient occulusion: Intensity of ambient occulusion effect
AO quality: boils down to the number of rays used to simulate light. 1 ---> 30. 3 is the reccomended 
value. Much slower than SSAO
Reflection: I believe this is the intensity of reflection of the environment map.
AO fast mode: Made for only specific paramters
Ray


SHADERS 2--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SCREEN SPACE AMBIENT OCCLUSION: Faster than ambient occlusion, lower quality. No color here
SSAO QUALITY: Essentially adjusts how good the shading is for the fractal. Better quality means 
smaller shadows are created and looks more 'crisp.' Quality is 'good' at 20 and excellent up to 50
GLOW COLORS: Colors of the glow. Don't know what causes them
BACKGROUND COLORS: Have no bearing on the actual color of the fractal, they all blend together into 
one gradient to get the background color


NOTES:

Ambient occlusion is the simulation of lighting that is sourced from AO color map as fake 
reflections

Opposite camera colors and environment maps gives some really cool effects
